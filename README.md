# Low-code-tool-form-builder
This is a low-code/ no-code tool to build dynamic forms that can export the code and work in any application
=======
# React + Vite

This is a Low-Code/No-Code Form Builder built with React and Vite that allows users to visually create and configure dynamic forms without writing code. The generated forms can be exported and embedded into any application. It’s ideal for teams who want to streamline form creation, improve UX consistency, and save development time.

⚙️ Features
Drag-and-drop form field builder
Field customization (labels, validation, etc.)
Real-time preview of the form
JSON-based form schema generation
Exportable form code (can be reused in other apps)
Built using React, Vite, and local state management
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Dharma-aaryan/Low-code-tool-form-builder.git
     cd Low-code-tool-form-builder
3. Install dependencies: npm install
4. Start the development server: npm run dev
5. Open your browser at http://localhost:5173 to start building forms!
6. Build for Production: npm run build

Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration
If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
